        <p class="main">
            A budget is a plan for individuals, groups, or companies on how they will spend money. 
            It guides your spendings to help you reach your financial goals.
        </p>

        <p class="main">According to a survey conducted by the Canadian government, about <strong>half the 
            Canadian population have a budget</strong>. When comparing the half that budget and the half 
            that do not, budgeters demonstrate <strong>more effective management of their money cash 
            flow</strong>, and are <strong>less likely to fall behind on their financial commitments</strong>. 
            Those that <strong>use digital tools have shown to be the best at managing their money</strong>.
